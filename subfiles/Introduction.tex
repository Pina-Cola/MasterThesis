	\section{Introduction} \label{section:introduction}
	
	
	The popularity of streaming is growing, with an increasing number of people using online streaming platforms for their entertainment and approximately 1.8 billion subscriptions to video streaming services~\cite{nielsen, stats}.
	%
	With this increased popularity, the demand for user-driven real-time visual customisation in the web browser for streamed videos has also increased.

	\subsection{Motivation} \label{subsection:motivation}
	
	
	The colouring of a video can evoke different emotions and set an overall tone for the perception of the content. For instance, cool colours such as blue can convey cold weather, while warm colours such as yellow can create a feeling of warmth and sunlight. A comparison of the same photo in different tones can be seen in Figure~\ref{figure:coloursblueandyellow}.
	The colouring of a video is a powerful tool that can significantly impact the conveyed mood and atmosphere~\cite{colorgrading1, colorgrading2}.
	
	% TODO: Only use colograding2 and not 1?

	The use-cases for on-the-fly adjustments of the video colour arise from different motivations. 
	One of them is that each screen, ranging from computer monitors, TVs, smartphones and tablets to beamers, has unique characteristics that can influence the perceived colour palette. 
	In addition, the light conditions can influence the appearance of the colours.
	With real-time colour corrections, the user can adjust the colour and cancel out variations that are caused by the device or environment to have a consistent experience~\cite{screentype}.
	
	% Real-time colour grading is a solution that not only addresses the variability in device displays but also enables users to adjust the image according to their preferences.
	%
	Additionally, users with visual problems or specific colour perception might benefit from real-time colour grading to enhance the visibility and distinction of the on-screen elements. 
	% The increased accessibility can contribute to enhanced inclusivity and enable a diverse range of users to engage with the content~\cite{accessibility}.
	The increased accessibility can improve inclusivity and enable a more diverse range of users to engage with the content~\cite{accessibility}.

	\subsection{Research Questions} \label{subsection:researchquestions}
	
	
	This thesis revolves around the implementation of video colour grading with the adjustment of the RGB values using Just-In-Time (JIT) techniques and the Media Lovin' Toolkit (MLT) framework. The MLT framework is a multimedia framework tool that can be used for video editing and playback. It is introduced and described in Section~\ref{subsection:melt}.
	JIT is used for on-the-fly conversion of video files and optimising them for streaming. 
	%This process includes the transformation of a video file, potentially one with non-web-friendly formats, into a more suitable format for the playback in web browsers.
	The demand for efficient and dynamic video processing tools is increasing and with this, the ability to perform on-the-fly colour correction becomes increasingly valuable. 
	This project lies in the area of multimedia processing, video editing and real-time computing and is done in cooperation with the company Codemill, which is introduced in Section~\ref{subsection:codemill}.
	
	
	The aim of this thesis is to explore the feasibility of implementing the video colour grading process with JIT, with the focus on real-time colour grading and to implement such a solution, if possible. This solution should contain three sliders in the frontend to adjust the individual RGB values: Red, green and blue. The colour adjustment should then be applied to the video output in real-time, while streaming the video.

	%
	%The infrastructure of the system is visualized and explained in Chapter~\ref{section:designandimplementation}.
	%
	%The project aims to address the feasibility and effectiveness of implementing video colour correction using JIT in the context of real-time video streaming. 
	The following question is relevant:
	
	\begin{researchbox}
		Is it possible to obtain colour-graded video results on the fly, meaning in real-time, using JIT and the MLT framework?
	\end{researchbox}
	
	If such an implementation is successful, the effectiveness of the grading process will be evaluated. A second research question is therefore: 
	
	\begin{researchbox}
		Is there variation in the outcomes of filter applications across various applications with a MLT backend and the specified system?
	\end{researchbox}


	The different applications for the comparison that use the MLT framework as a backend are the command line interface (CLI) video editor Melt and the video editing software KDEN Live. 
	
	
	By answering the research questions above, this project aims to provide insights into the technological and scientific aspects of real-time video processing, exploring the possibilities and potential applications introduced by using JIT and the MLT framework to implement colour grading. 
	%
	The challenges of this thesis project include the understanding of the complex codebase of the Accurate Player and implementing the RGB adjustment in it, comprehending the sparse MLT documentation and finding a valid method to evaluate and compare the results from different platforms.

		\item[RGB representation] 
		
		This thesis revolves around RGB colour adjustment, making the understanding of RGB colour representation an important aspect. Additionally, the results of different methods for the RGB colour adjustment are analysed with the \textit{grain extract} function in GIMP, making it necessary to understand the RGB colour model to understand the functionality and results.
		One source discussing RGB colour representation and the concepts of additive and subtractive colour models is \textit{Color: An Introduction to Practice and Principles} by Rolf G. Kuehni~\cite{colourRGB}. 
		
		
		
		
				
		
		%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		\item[GIMP]
		
		
		The book \textit{The Book of GIMP: A Complete Guide to Nearly Everything} by Olivier Lecarme and Karine Delvare describes nearly every function in GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP)~\cite{gimp}.
		%
		This includes the \textit{grain extract} function that is relevant for the MLT filter comparison between different platforms in this thesis project.
		%
		Furthermore, understanding techniques for evaluating and editing media content is important within the realm of multimedia processing.
		
		
		
		
		
		%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		\item[Colour grading] 
		
		To describe the terminology and differences between colour grading and colour correction according to the industry standards, a variety of web pages and articles were consulted. They are used to reflect the usage of the terminology in the field. 
		% Using the correct terminology ensures effective communication and searchability.		
		%
		One web page is titled \textit{Understanding What Color Correction And Color Grading Are – And Aren’t} from Vegas. Vegas (former Sony Vegas) is a video editing program from the company Magix, which is widely known as a prominent company within the video editing field~\cite{cc_cg_1}.
		%
		Other web pages were referenced to confirm the usage of the terms colour grading and colour correction in the industry as described to ensure that the terminology aligns with the commonly accepted standards within the field. 
		%This includes the web page with the title \textit{Color Correcting vs. Color Grading: Understanding Film Coloring} from MasterClass, an online learning platform.~\cite{cc_cg_2} 
		%
		%
		Furthermore, the book \textit{The Art and Technique of Digital Color Correction} by Steve Hullfish discusses the topic of colour correction and video post-production in more depth~\cite{cc1}.
		
		
		
		%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		\item[Effects of different colour]
		
		
		The paper \textit{Color and psychological functioning: a review of theoretical and empirical work} from Andrew J. Elliot discusses theoretical insights and empirical findings on the psychological effect of colours~\cite{colour}.
		%		
		Furthermore, in \textit{Effects of color on emotions} from Patricia Valdez and Albert Mehrabian, emotional reactions to colours are investigated and attributes are assigned to specific colours that they are associated with~\cite{colour2}.
		%
		Understanding the effects of different colours is important for the motivation of this thesis and for meeting the users needs and requirements, which is relevant for the implementation in this thesis project.
		

		
	
		
		
		%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		\item[MLT framework]
		
		
		The MLT framework is a crucial part for this thesis project. 
		%
		The RGB colour adjustment is implemented using MLT as a backend and the results are compared with other applications using a MLT backend.
		%
		For this, information directly from the MLT website itself was consulted~\cite{melt}.
		%
		Especially the list of different MLT filters and plug-ins was considered, to compare the filters and select the most suitable option for the RGB adjustment.
		% 
		Additionally, the code of the MLT framework was examined~\cite{melt_filters, melt_code}.
		%
		The external literature on the MLT framework and its technical aspects is unfortunately limited.
		%
		
		
		
	
		
		
		%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		\item[Protocol buffer] 
		
		The Chapter \textit{Proto Buffer} in the book \textit{Mobile Forensics -- The File Format Handbook: Common File Formats and File Systems Used in Mobile Devices} by Chris Currier introduces and discusses the topic of protocol buffers~\cite{protobuffer}. This is relevant for the data transfer from the frontend to the MLT framework in the implementation for this thesis project.
		
		
		
	
		\newpage
		
		%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		\item[Multimedia processing] 
		
		The topic of multimedia processing is widely spread and has many different areas. This resulted in many papers, standards and documentations being used as sources to be combined into the overall context of this thesis project. Individual references have been consulted for various components including WebRTC, JIT and video transcoding, which are relevant for this thesis project.
		
		% This includes for example the IEEE standards and publications \textit{IEEE Transactions on Multimedia}, \textit{IEEE Standard for Learning Technology -- JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Data Model Format and Representational State Transfer (RESTful) Web Service for Learner Experience Data Tracking and Access}, \textit{WebRTC technology overview and signaling solution design and implementation}, \textit{Overview of the H.264/AVC video coding standard} and \textit{Guided just-in-time transcoding for cloud-based video platforms}.~\cite{transcoding, IEEE_Rest, webrtc, h264, JIT_IEEE}
