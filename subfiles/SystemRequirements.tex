\section{System Requirements and Specifications} \label{section:systemrequirementsandspecifications}

%Define the overall goals and objectives of your project.
%Specify the functional and non-functional requirements of the system. This includes what the system is expected to do, its features, and any constraints it must adhere to.
%Outline any specific hardware or software requirements necessary for the project.
%Detail the methodologies or approaches you'll use for system development.



%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{User Requirements} \label{subsection:userrequirements}
% Identify and describe the requirements from the end-user perspective.




%Who are the primary users of the system?
%What are the main tasks or activities that users will perform using the system?
%What are the goals and objectives of the users when interacting with the system?
%What are the characteristics of the users, such as technical expertise, age, education level, etc.?
%What are the environmental considerations, such as the location and conditions in which the system will be used?
%Are there any regulatory or legal requirements that need to be considered regarding user interaction?
%What are the usability expectations or preferences of the users regarding interface design, navigation, etc.?
%Are there any accessibility requirements that need to be addressed for users with disabilities?
%Are there any cultural or language considerations that need to be accommodated for the users?

\subsection{Technical Requirements} \label{subsection:technicalrequirements}
% Detail the technical requirements for the system.


In this Section, the technical requirements for the system are described. These requirements provide the necessary standards to ensure the systems functionality

Regarding the hardware requirements, the system should be capable of running the frontend development tool Yarn and executing the python backend and Melt framework within a Docker container.
While implementing, it was observed that the system should have a minimum of $16$GB RAM to ensure smooth execution of the development environment and Docker containers.



The software requirements include information about the operating system, applications and frameworks.
While testing, the code seemed to not run on Windows. Because of this, a Linux system (Ubuntu 22.04) was used. Regarding the documentation in the README files, the Mac operating system should be able to run the code after making adjustments, but this was not tested in the scope of this thesis.


In addition to this, the system relies on several software components.
Docker is needed to use Docker containers for encapsulating the system's backend. This allows consistent and efficient results across different devices.
Node.js serves as the runtime environment for executing JavaScript code for web applications and Yarn is the package manager for Node.js applications, that is used in this project.
Git is essential for version control. While it is not strictly required for the system's execution, Git is used to pull git repositories containing the code and necessary dependencies and frameworks, such as the Melt framework. 
An installation of the Melt framework is not needed for the execution or development of this system, but can be useful for testing or exploring the functionality of Melt.


TODO

What are the security requirements for protecting the system and its data from unauthorized access or breaches?

The Docker containers use a \textit{you snooze you lose} approach, where the container terminates automatically if there are no incoming requests within a certain time frame. 

In addition to this, the system adheres to standard security practices.
